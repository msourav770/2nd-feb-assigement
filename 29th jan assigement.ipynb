    "Q2.which type of programing does python support?\n",
    "Answer:-Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. \n",
    "         Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, \n",
    "         and many of their features support functional programming and aspect-oriented\n",
    "         programming (including metaprogramming and metaobjects)\n",

    "Q3.Is python case sensitive when dealing with identifiers.\n",
    "Answer:-Yes, Python is a case-sensitive language, i.e., it treats uppercase and lowercase characters differently.\n",
    "        This applies to identifiers too.\n",
    "        You must avoid using the same name with different cases while naming identifiers. \n",
    "        It is always good to use names that are more easily understood. \n",
    "        If you want to store counts of 2 values, you would rather name your variables count1 and count2 \n",
    "        instead of naming them C and c. \n",

    "        a block of code in most programming languages, like C, C++, and Java. \n",
    "        But this indentation makes python unique among all programming languages.\n",
    "        This indentation highlights the block of code. In Python, \n",
    "        indentation is done with whitespace. All statements with the same right-hand distance\n",
    "        belong to the same code block. If a block needs to be more nested, it is indented to the right."
